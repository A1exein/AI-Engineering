    "## Task 3: LangChain Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into agents, let's understand the fundamental building blocks of LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Runnable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Runnable** is the core abstraction in LangChain - think of it as a standardized component that:\n",
    "- Takes an input\n",
    "- Performs some operation\n",
    "- Returns an output\n",
    "\n",
    "Every component in LangChain (models, prompts, retrievers, parsers) is a Runnable, which means they all share the same interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = runnable.invoke(input)           # Single input\n",
    "results = runnable.batch([input1, input2]) # Multiple inputs\n",
    "for chunk in runnable.stream(input):       # Streaming\n",
    "    print(chunk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL** allows you to chain Runnables together using the `|` (pipe) operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | model | output_parser\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"query\": \"Hello!\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to Unix pipes - the output of one component becomes the input to the next."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Task 4: Understanding the Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **agent** is a system that uses an LLM to decide what actions to take. Unlike a simple chain that follows a fixed sequence, an agent can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reason** about what to do next\n",
    "2. **Take actions** by calling tools\n",
    "3. **Observe** the results\n",
    "4. **Iterate** until the task is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agent Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of every agent is the **agent loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                          AGENT LOOP                         \n",
    "                                                             \n",
    "      +----------+     +----------+     +----------+         \n",
    "      |  Model   | --> |   Tool   | --> |  Model   | --> ... \n",
    "      |   Call   |     |   Call   |     |   Call   |         \n",
    "      +----------+     +----------+     +----------+         \n",
    "           |                                  |              \n",
    "           v                                  v              \n",
    "      \"Use search\"                   \"Here's the answer\"     \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Call**: The LLM receives the current state and decides whether to:\n",
    "   - Call a tool (continue the loop)\n",
    "   - Return a final answer (exit the loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Call**: If the model decides to use a tool, the tool is executed and its output is added to the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat**: The loop continues until the model decides it has enough information to answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `create_agent`?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain 1.0 introduced `create_agent` as the new standard way to build agents. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified API**: One function to create production-ready agents\n",
    "- **Middleware Support**: Hook into any point in the agent loop\n",
    "- **Built on LangGraph**: Uses the battle-tested LangGraph runtime under the hood"

      "\n",
      "## Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) Investment Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Investment Philosophy:**\n",
      "- Stone Ridge Energy has purchased almost **$11 billion of energy assets** since inception\n",
      "- All acquisitions are done via **proprietary securitizations** with \"no bankers, no information leakage, no fee leakage\"\n",
      "- They focus on aligning physics and finance, with teams \"crisply aligned on maximizing a singular metric – total dollars of operating profit\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Performance Results:**\n",
      "- Across thirteen equity tranches, their integrated approach has produced **>20% annual returns with low volatility and no correlation to anything**\n",
      "- This performance was achieved despite natural gas prices fluctuating dramatically from $1.50/MMBtu to almost $9/MMBtu\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategic Vision:**\n",
      "- Stone Ridge sees SRE becoming \"a different kind of company\" over the next five years\n",
      "- Their goal is to become a **top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons** through disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and process improvement\n",
      "- They emphasize the civic importance of their work, aiming to meaningfully impact U.S. families, factories, and national competitiveness\n",
      "- More than 99% of their managed capital comes from American investors\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investment Calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "For your second question: If Stone Ridge invested $100 million with a 50% return over 12 years, the total value would be **$150 million**.\n",

    "\n",
    "How does **Agentic RAG** differ from traditional RAG? What are the advantages and potential disadvantages of letting the agent decide when to retrieve information from the Stone Ridge investor letters?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "Agentic RAG combines the external information retrieval capabilities of traditional RAG with a dynamic reasoning and action loop enabled by agents. Agentic RAG can generate an answer to a given input question in multiple steps, using tool calls and LLM reasoning each time to hone the current output to the format of the expected answer.<br><br>\n",
    "The agentic approach has the advantage of performing multiple rounds of auomtated reasoning between rounds of external infomration acquisition to get answers to complex, multi-part questions, without requirng a human to stitch the output of one tool to the input of another tool or model reply. The agentic approach can also result in unnecessary use of tools, consuming more tokens and prolonging the time taken to answer simple questions. It also requires the agent to re-check all of its available tools at each step, costing time and compute."

    "Looking at the middleware examples (`log_before_model`, `log_after_model`, and `ModelCallLimitMiddleware`), describe a real-world scenario where middleware would be essential for a production agent. What specific middleware hooks would you use and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "Middleware is essential in production agents for monitoring, governance, and reliability across several critical scenarios. In regulated industries like healthcare and finance, compliance and audit trail middleware is required to record PII access, tool usage, and data sources while redacting sensitive information from logs, proving what data was accessed and how decisions were made. For reliability, retry-with-backoff middleware handles transient API failures, circuit breaker middleware prevents cascading failures when upstream services are down, and rate limiting middleware respects API quotas to prevent a single complex query from exhausting rate limits and breaking the service for everyone."
