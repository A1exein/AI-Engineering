    "\n",
    "Before diving into agents, let's understand the fundamental building blocks of LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Runnable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Runnable** is the core abstraction in LangChain - think of it as a standardized component that:\n",
    "- Takes an input\n",
    "- Performs some operation\n",
    "- Returns an output\n",
    "\n",
    "Every component in LangChain (models, prompts, retrievers, parsers) is a Runnable, which means they all share the same interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = runnable.invoke(input)           # Single input\n",
    "results = runnable.batch([input1, input2]) # Multiple inputs\n",
    "for chunk in runnable.stream(input):       # Streaming\n",
    "    print(chunk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL** allows you to chain Runnables together using the `|` (pipe) operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | model | output_parser\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"query\": \"Hello!\"})\n",
    "```\n",

    "   - Call a tool (continue the loop)\n",
    "   - Return a final answer (exit the loop)\n",

    "2. **Tool Call**: If the model decides to use a tool, the tool is executed and its output is added to the conversation\n",

    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "THe agent will call models and tools until it determines it has the necessary amount of information to answer the question that was posed. The agent makes alternating calls to the LLM and associated tools, building up a list of intermediate messages. If the message replies contain 'tool_call' identifiers, the agent will call those tools and then re-evaulate its current output. If no tool calls are present in the msot recently added message the agent returns the last message in the list as the final answer."

    "The docstrings for the tool functions tell the agent what kind of extra capabilities it has available, and what the expected input arguments and output structure of those functional capabilities are. It can deteremine which of its existing tools is most capable of addressing the most recent message in the chain, without having to parse through the actual logic in the tool function itself."

      "Based on the Stone Ridge investment knowledge base, here's what Stone Ridge says about their energy investments:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) Investment Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Investment Philosophy:**\n",
      "- Stone Ridge Energy has purchased almost **$11 billion of energy assets** since inception\n",
      "- All acquisitions are done via **proprietary securitizations** with \"no bankers, no information leakage, no fee leakage\"\n",
      "- They focus on aligning physics and finance, with teams \"crisply aligned on maximizing a singular metric – total dollars of operating profit\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Performance Results:**\n",
      "- Across thirteen equity tranches, their integrated approach has produced **>20% annual returns with low volatility and no correlation to anything**\n",
      "- This performance was achieved despite natural gas prices fluctuating dramatically from $1.50/MMBtu to almost $9/MMBtu\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategic Vision:**\n",
      "- Stone Ridge sees SRE becoming \"a different kind of company\" over the next five years\n",
      "- Their goal is to become a **top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons** through disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and process improvement\n",
      "- They emphasize the civic importance of their work, aiming to meaningfully impact U.S. families, factories, and national competitiveness\n",
      "- More than 99% of their managed capital comes from American investors\n",
      "\n",
      "## Investment Calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "For your second question: If Stone Ridge invested $100 million with a 50% return over 12 years, the total value would be **$150 million**.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Please note: This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice. Past performance does not guarantee future results.*\n"

    "## ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "How does **Agentic RAG** differ from traditional RAG? What are the advantages and potential disadvantages of letting the agent decide when to retrieve information from the Stone Ridge investor letters?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "Agentic RAG combines the external information retrieval capabilities of traditional RAG with a dynamic reasoning and action loop enabled by agents. Agentic RAG can generate an answer to a given input question in multiple steps, using tool calls and LLM reasoning each time to hone the current output to the format of the expected answer.<br><br>\n",
    "The agentic approach has the advantage of performing multiple rounds of auomtated reasoning between rounds of external infomration acquisition to get answers to complex, multi-part questions, without requirng a human to stitch the output of one tool to the input of another tool or model reply. The agentic approach can also result in unnecessary use of tools, consuming more tokens and prolonging the time taken to answer simple questions. It also requires the agent to re-check all of its available tools at each step, costing time and compute."

    "Looking at the middleware examples (`log_before_model`, `log_after_model`, and `ModelCallLimitMiddleware`), describe a real-world scenario where middleware would be essential for a production agent. What specific middleware hooks would you use and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "Middleware is essential in production agents for monitoring, governance, and reliability across several critical scenarios.In regulated industries like healthcare and finance, compliance and audit trail middleware is required to record PII access, tool usage, and data sources while redacting sensitive information from logs, proving what data was accessed and how decisions were made. For reliability, retry-with-backoff middleware handles transient API failures, circuit breaker middleware prevents cascading failures when upstream services are down, and rate limiting middleware respects API quotas to prevent a single complex query from exhausting rate limits and breaking the service for everyone.
