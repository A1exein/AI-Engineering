## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion during Part 1 and Part 2!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the Agent Engineering - SRHG challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

        - modulating written voice
        - honing in on salient details

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer:
Yes

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What can I cook with carrots, beef and chicken stock?
   - Result:
        Great combo—you’ve got the makings of a cozy stew or a light soup. Here are a few easy options:

        1) Simple beef and carrot stew (3 ingredients)
        - You’ll need: about 1 lb beef (chuck or stewing beef), 4–5 carrots (chunked), 4 cups chicken stock, salt/pepper.
        - Steps:
        - Pat beef dry, season, sear in a little oil until well browned.
        - Add stock, scrape up browned bits, bring to a simmer.
        - Add carrots, cover and simmer gently until beef is tender, 1.5–2 hours. Adjust seasoning.
        - Optional boosters if you have them: onion/garlic, bay leaf, thyme, splash of soy sauce or Worcestershire, a spoon of tomato paste.

        2) Quick beef and carrot soup
        - Slice beef thinly against the grain; slice carrots.
        - Simmer carrots in chicken stock 10–12 minutes until tender.
        - Season stock, then add the sliced beef and cook just 2–3 minutes until just done. Finish with black pepper.
        - Optional: noodles or rice, a squeeze of lemon, scallions, parsley.

        3) Carrot soup with seared beef topper
        - Simmer carrots in stock until very soft; blend until smooth and season.
        - Quickly sear thin slices or small cubes of beef in a hot pan, salt/pepper.
        - Ladle carrot soup into bowls and top with the beef and any pan juices.

        If you tell me what cut of beef and what pantry items you have (onion, herbs, soy, tomato paste, potatoes, noodles), I can tailor the best version and timing. You’ve got this!

2. Prompt: Draft an eMail to my boss asking for a raise
   - Result:
        Here are a few polished, customizable drafts you can use. Pick the tone that fits your relationship with your boss and plug in your specifics.

        Subject line options:
        - Request to discuss my compensation
        - Compensation review request
        - Quick chat about my role and compensation
        - Aligning my role, impact, and pay

        Direct and professional:
        Hello [Boss’s Name],

        I appreciate your support on [recent project or initiative]. Over the past [time period], I have:
        - [Achievement 1 with a clear metric or outcome]
        - [Achievement 2 with metric or scope]
        - [New responsibility or leadership you’ve taken on]

        Given these contributions and market benchmarks for [your role] in [location/industry], I’d like to discuss aligning my compensation. I’m seeking [target salary or X% increase], and I’m open to discussing structure and timing.

        Could we schedule 20–30 minutes next week to talk this through?

        Thanks for your consideration,
        [Your Name]
        ...

3. Prompt: what kind of birthday celebration should I plan for my girlfriend (in her 20s) on March 8
   - Result:
        Fun timing—March 8 is also International Women’s Day, so spots can book up and you can weave in a little “celebrating her” theme. A great plan balances what she loves, a personal touch, and a clear flow to the day.

        Quick questions to tailor it:
        - What are 3 things she loves (food, hobbies, vibe)?
        - Intimate just-you-two or social with friends/family?
        - Surprise or collaborative?
        - Budget range and how much time you can spend planning?
        - Any dietary needs or mobility/weather constraints?

        Ready-to-use celebration ideas (pick one style or mix and match):
        1) Romantic and personal (just you two)
        - Morning: Breakfast in bed + a handwritten letter celebrating who she is (Women’s Day tie-in).
        - Midday: Cozy spa date (couples massage) or a pottery/candle-making class.
        - Evening: Private chef at home or a small chef’s tasting/omakase. Create a playlist of “your story,” decorate with purple/green/white or mimosa flowers.
        - Gift: A small engraved piece or a photo book of your favorite moments.

        2) Experience-first adventure
        - Sunrise or golden-hour hike with a thermos of cocoa and a picnic (weather-ready kit).
        - Afternoon: Museum or botanical garden, then a surprise activity she’s mentioned (glassblowing, aerial yoga, climbing, cooking class).
        - Night: Dessert crawl at three spots or a rooftop with a city view.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer:
Yes, the vibes are mostly aligned. It's responses are a bit verbose but, that can be tuned. It's obviously missing access to my real personal info, which would make its responses more tailored to me individually but, the answers it currently gives back aren't that bad.
---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What does my schedule look like tomorrow?
   - Result:
        I don’t have access to your calendar, so I can’t see tomorrow’s events yet. Want me to:
            - Summarize your existing schedule? Paste your calendar entries (a screenshot or a list works) and I’ll turn it into a clear timeline with priorities.
            - Help you plan the day from scratch? I’ll build a balanced schedule around your commitments and goals.
        ...
2. Prompt: What time should I leave for the airport?
   - Result:
        Happy to help you pick a leave time that keeps things calm instead of rushed. A couple details will let me give you a precise answer:
            - Which airport (and terminal, if you know)?
            - Departure time and day of week?
            - Domestic or international?
            - How are you getting there (drive/ride-share/public transit), and how long does that trip usually take at that time? Will you park and take a shuttle?
            - Checking bags? Do you have TSA PreCheck/CLEAR (or your country’s equivalent)?
            - Traveling with kids or anyone needing extra time?

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer:
The LLM application is missing critical personal context that would help it tailor its answers to my specific situation.
