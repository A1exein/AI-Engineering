    "# Agent Memory: Building Memory-Enabled Investment Agents with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building a Stone Ridge Investment Advisory Assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified investment advisory agent\n",

      "Assistant: Given your profile and investment goals, I recommend a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your objectives of long-term growth and income generation while adhering to your moderate risk tolerance and ESG preferences. Here’s a comprehensive approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Asset Allocation**\n",
      "   - **Equities (60%)**: Focus on a diversified mix of growth and dividend-paying stocks. Given your ESG preference, consider investing in:\n",
      "     - **ESG-focused ETFs or mutual funds**: These funds typically invest in companies with strong environmental, social, and governance practices.\n",
      "     - **Sustainable sectors**: Look into technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, which are expected to grow significantly over the long term.\n",
      "   - **Fixed Income (40%)**: To generate income and reduce volatility, consider:\n",
      "     - **ESG-compliant bonds**: These can include green bonds or social bonds that fund projects with positive environmental or social impacts.\n",
      "     - **Corporate bonds**: Focus on investment-grade bonds to maintain a moderate risk profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Diversification**\n",
      "   - Ensure your equity investments are diversified across sectors and geographies to mitigate risk. Consider including international stocks to capture growth in emerging markets.\n",
      "   - Within fixed income, diversify between government and corporate bonds, as well as different maturities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Rebalancing**\n",
      "   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target allocation. This could be done annually or semi-annually, depending on market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Income Generation**\n",
      "   - Look for dividend-paying stocks and funds that align with your ESG criteria. This will help you generate income while still focusing on growth.\n",
      "   - Consider using a portion of your bond allocation to invest in high-yield bonds, but be cautious of the associated risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Monitoring and Reporting**\n",
      "   - Since you prefer quarterly reporting, set up a system to track key metrics such as CAGR, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown. This will help you assess the performance of your investments and make informed decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Avoiding Restrictions**\n",
      "   - Ensure that none of your investments include tobacco stocks, as per your restrictions. This can be easily managed by selecting ESG-focused funds that explicitly exclude such companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This strategy aims to balance growth and income while adhering to your risk tolerance and ethical preferences. As you have a long investment horizon of 20 years, this approach should position you well for achieving your financial goals. \n",

      "User (NEW thread): Are there any risks I should be aware of given my portfolio?\n",
      "Assistant: Given your portfolio's allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, there are several risks to consider, especially in the context of your long-term growth and income generation goals, as well as your moderate risk tolerance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Risk**: With a significant portion of your portfolio in stocks, you are exposed to market volatility. Economic downturns can lead to declines in stock prices, which may affect your long-term growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Interest Rate Risk**: Your bond allocation is subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds may decline, which could impact your portfolio's overall performance, especially if you hold long-term bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inflation Risk**: Over a 20-year horizon, inflation can erode the purchasing power of your returns. While stocks generally provide a hedge against inflation over the long term, it's important to ensure that your bond investments are also positioned to mitigate this risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sector and Geographic Concentration**: Depending on the specific stocks and bonds you hold, you may be exposed to sector-specific or geographic risks. Diversification across various sectors and regions can help mitigate this risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **ESG Risks**: Since you have an ESG preference, be aware that companies with strong ESG practices may perform differently than those that do not prioritize these factors. While ESG investments can be resilient, they may also face unique challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Liquidity Risk**: While stocks are generally liquid, certain bonds or specific investments may not be as easily tradable, which could pose a risk if you need to access cash quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regulatory Risk**: Changes in regulations, especially those affecting ESG criteria or specific industries, can impact the performance of your investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "To manage these risks, consider regularly reviewing your portfolio's performance against your goals and adjusting your asset allocation as needed. Additionally, maintaining a diversified portfolio and staying informed about market trends can help you navigate potential challenges.

Short-term memory is automatically retained whereas long-term memory has to be explicitly augmented and maintained. In the realm of investment data, long-term memory is necessary for storing compliance information (disclosures, legal limits, who asked what and when, etc.), firm-level risk tolerance data, user-level and system-level preferences and business logic. If a piece of info can be used by multiple users across sessions, or if its required for regulatory reasons than it should be moved from short-term to long-term storage."

If the same body of context is going to be retrieved when answering every question, it's helpful to have that context be as small and as quickly parsable as possible. Any information deemed critical for safety and compliance, or information that will be relevant for future questions should always be retained. Long blobs of context should be periodically summarized to reduce the number of tokens required to scan and integrate that context into future question responses. In summarizing and re-compacting the context, it is important to bubble-up important data that may have otherwise been buried in long blobs of context."

      "\n",
      "1. **Investment-Grade Bonds (50%)**: Given your preference for capital preservation and steady income, a significant portion of your portfolio should be allocated to investment-grade bonds. These bonds typically offer lower risk and provide regular interest payments, which can help meet your income needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dividend Stocks (30%)**: Allocating a portion of your portfolio to dividend-paying stocks can provide a steady income stream while still allowing for some potential capital appreciation. Focus on established companies with a history of stable dividends, as they tend to be less volatile and align with your conservative approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cash Equivalents (20%)**: Keeping a portion of your portfolio in cash equivalents, such as money market funds or short-term Treasury bills, will provide liquidity and safety. This allocation can help you manage any short-term needs and protect your capital against market fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Recommended Asset Allocation:\n",
      "- **Investment-Grade Bonds**: 50%\n",
      "- **Dividend Stocks**: 30%\n",
      "- **Cash Equivalents**: 20%\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Considerations:\n",
      "- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially if market conditions change.\n",

      "Assistant: Given your aggressive risk tolerance, long-term investment horizon of 30 years, and primary goal of maximum long-term growth with a secondary focus on compounding, I recommend the following asset allocation for your $200K portfolio:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Growth Equities (50%)**: Allocate around $100K to growth equities, focusing on sectors with high potential for growth such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. Consider investing in both U.S. and international growth stocks, including those in emerging markets, to diversify your exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emerging Markets (20%)**: With your interest in emerging markets, allocate about $40K here. These markets can offer significant growth potential, albeit with higher volatility. Look for ETFs or mutual funds that focus on emerging market equities to gain broad exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Alternatives (20%)**: Allocate $40K to alternative investments, which can include real estate investment trusts (REITs), private equity, or commodities. These can provide diversification and potential for higher returns, aligning with your aggressive strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cryptocurrency (10%)**: Given your preference for crypto, consider allocating $20K to this asset class. Focus on established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also consider a small portion in promising altcoins. Be mindful of the volatility and regulatory landscape in this space.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **ESG Considerations**: Since you have an ESG preference, ensure that your investments in growth equities and alternatives include companies or funds that prioritize environmental, social, and governance factors. Many growth-focused funds now incorporate ESG criteria, which can align with your values while still pursuing aggressive growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation balances your desire for maximum long-term growth with your aggressive risk tolerance, while also considering your interest in emerging markets and crypto. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain this allocation and adjust for market conditions over your 30-year horizon.\n"

      "**Types of Alternative Investments:**\n",
      "- **Real Estate:** This includes Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or direct property ownership, which can provide rental income and capital appreciation.\n",
      "- **Private Equity:** Investing in private companies or funds that target private equity can offer high returns, though they often come with higher risk and longer investment horizons.\n",
      "- **Hedge Funds:** These funds employ various strategies to generate returns, including long/short equity, market neutral, and global macro strategies.\n",
      "- **Commodities:** Investing in physical goods like gold, oil, or agricultural products can hedge against inflation and provide diversification.\n",
      "- **Cryptocurrencies:** Digital currencies can offer high volatility and potential returns, but they also come with significant risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of Alternative Investments:**\n",
      "- **Diversification:** They often have low correlation with traditional asset classes, which can reduce overall portfolio risk.\n",
      "- **Access to Unique Opportunities:** Alternatives can provide exposure to markets and sectors not available through traditional investments.\n",
      "- **Potential for Higher Returns:** Some alternatives may offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Considerations:**\n",
      "- **Liquidity:** Many alternative investments are less liquid than stocks and bonds, meaning it may take longer to sell your investment.\n",
      "- **Investment Horizon:** Some alternatives require a longer commitment, so consider your time frame and liquidity needs.\n",
      "- **Due Diligence:** Thorough research is essential, as these investments can be complex and may involve higher fees.\n",
      "- **Regulatory Environment:** Be aware of the regulatory landscape, especially for investments like cryptocurrencies or private equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical Allocation:**\n",
      "A common recommendation is to allocate about 10-20% of your portfolio to alternative investments, depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals.\n",

      "User: How should I think about portfolio risk?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant (v1 instructions):\n",
      "Thinking about portfolio risk involves understanding several key concepts and factors that can influence the performance of your investments. Here are some important considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your personal risk tolerance, which is your ability and willingness to endure fluctuations in the value of your investments. This can be influenced by factors such as your investment goals, time horizon, and financial situation. Would you consider yourself conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investment approach?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diversification**: Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and sectors can help mitigate risk. By spreading investments, you reduce the impact of a poor-performing asset on your overall portfolio. Have you considered how diversified your current portfolio is?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Volatility**: Understand that different asset classes have varying levels of volatility. Stocks, for example, tend to be more volatile than bonds. Historical data can provide insights into the expected volatility of different investments. Are you comfortable with the potential for short-term fluctuations in your portfolio?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Correlation**: Look at how different assets in your portfolio move in relation to one another. Assets that are negatively correlated can help reduce overall portfolio risk. For instance, when stocks are down, bonds may perform better. Have you analyzed the correlation between the assets in your portfolio?\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time Horizon**: Your investment time frame can significantly affect your risk profile. Longer time horizons typically allow for more risk, as you have time to recover from market downturns. What is your investment time horizon for your current goals?\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Market Conditions**: Be aware of the current economic environment and market conditions, as these can impact the risk associated with different investments. For example, rising interest rates can affect bond prices. Are you keeping up with current market trends and economic indicators?\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your desired level of risk. As certain investments grow or decline, your portfolio may drift from your intended asset allocation. How often do you review your portfolio?\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Past Performance**: Remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. While historical data can provide insights, it’s essential to consider current market conditions and future expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "By considering these factors, you can develop a more comprehensive understanding of portfolio risk and make informed investment decisions. Would you like to discuss your specific investment goals or any particular concerns you have regarding your portfolio?\n"

      "To provide tailored investment opportunities, I would need to understand your risk tolerance and investment goals. Here are a few clarifying questions:\n",

      "1. What is your risk tolerance? Are you more conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investment approach?\n",

Consider ETFs that track indices with strong fundamentals and growth prospects. However, ensure that the sectors align with your risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dividend Stocks**: Companies with a strong history of paying dividends can provide a steady income stream, especially in volatile markets. Look for companies with a solid balance sheet and a history of increasing dividends. This can be a more conservative approach if you are risk-averse.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**: With interest rates stabilizing, REITs can offer attractive yields and potential for capital appreciation. They can be a good option for income-focused investors, but be mindful of the specific sectors within real estate, as some may be more affected by economic conditions than others.\n",

      "User: Can you tell me more about the alternative investments you mentioned?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant: Certainly! Alternative investments refer to asset classes that fall outside of traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and cash. They can provide diversification and potentially enhance returns, but they also come with unique risks. Here are some common types of alternative investments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Real Estate**: Investing in physical properties or real estate investment trusts (REITs) can provide income through rent and potential appreciation in property value. However, real estate markets can be volatile and require significant capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Private Equity**: This involves investing in private companies or buyouts of public companies. While private equity can offer high returns, it typically requires a longer investment horizon and is less liquid than public equities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hedge Funds**: These funds employ various strategies to generate returns, including long/short equity, arbitrage, and global macro. They often require high minimum investments and can have complex fee structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Commodities**: Investing in physical goods like gold, oil, or agricultural products can serve as a hedge against inflation. However, commodity prices can be highly volatile and influenced by geopolitical factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained popularity as alternative investments. They can offer high returns but are also highly speculative and subject to regulatory changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Collectibles**: Items such as art, antiques, or rare coins can appreciate in value over time. However, they require expertise to evaluate and can be illiquid.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actionable Insights:\n",
      "1. **Diversification**: Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to alternative investments to diversify your risk and potentially enhance returns. A common recommendation is to limit alternatives to 10-20% of your overall portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Research and Due Diligence**: Before investing in alternatives, conduct thorough research to understand the specific risks and market dynamics associated with each asset class.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexity of alternative investments, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Balanced Perspective:\n",
      "While alternative investments can offer unique opportunities, they also come with risks such as illiquidity, lack of transparency, and potential for loss. It's essential to weigh these factors against your overall investment strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, past performance does not guarantee future results, so it's crucial to approach alternative investments with caution and informed decision-making.\n",

    "## ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you decide what constitutes a **\"successful\" investment advisory interaction** worth storing as an episode? What metadata should you store alongside the episode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Explicit feedback (thumbs up) vs implicit signals\n",
    "- User engagement (did they ask follow-up questions?)\n",
    "- Objective outcomes vs subjective satisfaction\n",
    "- Privacy implications of storing interaction data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "A \"successful\" interaction should be identified through a combination of **explicit and implicit signals**, since relying on either alone is insufficient. Explicit feedback (thumbs up/down, star ratings) is the strongest signal but rare—most users don't bother. Implicit signals fill the gap: follow-up questions suggest the user found the advice useful enough to explore further, while abrupt topic changes or session abandonment suggest the opposite. A simple scoring heuristic could combine these: `explicit_positive + follow_up_count > 1 + no_negative_feedback` → store as episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata to store alongside each episode:**\n",
    "- **Situation/context**: user profile snapshot at the time (risk tolerance, horizon, portfolio size)\n",
    "- **Query category**: diversification, risk management, alternatives, etc.\n",
    "- **Response structure**: what format worked (bullet list, numbered steps, pros/cons)\n",
    "- **Engagement metrics**: number of follow-ups, session duration, whether the user acted on advice\n",
    "- **Timestamp and version**: when the episode occurred and which procedural instructions were active\n",
    "- **Anonymized user segment**: (e.g., \"conservative retiree\") rather than PII, to enable retrieval without privacy risk\n",
    "\n",
    "**Privacy consideration**: episodes should be scrubbed of personally identifiable information before storage. Store the *pattern* (situation → response style → outcome), not the raw conversation with names, account numbers, or portfolio specifics. This lets episodic memory improve the agent without creating a compliance liability."

    "## ❓ Question #4:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **production investment advisory assistant**, which memory types need persistent storage (PostgreSQL) vs in-memory? How would you handle memory across multiple agent instances (e.g., Market Outlook Agent, Strategy Agent, Risk Management Agent)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Which memories are user-specific vs shared?\n",
    "- Consistency requirements across agents\n",
    "- Memory expiration and cleanup policies\n",
    "- Namespace strategy for multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Everything but short-term memory requires persistent storage like Postgres. It's acceptable for short-term memory to be stored in-memory per user session because presumably only the current user's session would need to access to that info and there is less harm to the chat experience if only the current session's state gets dropped or overwritten. Every other state type (procedural, semantic, episodic, long-term) would need persisten storage in a shared DB layer because that type of memory needs to be persisted between multiple sessions for different users and that type of memory often takes up more storage space, potentially more space than can fit in a single machine's RAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory across multiple agent instances can be stored in agent-specific blocks in a properly namespaced environment. Memory blocks can be organized in persisten strorage by some combination of the agent_id, session_id and memory type (episodic, procedural, etc.). When handling memory across multiple agent instances, you could break up the blocks by information type (market info, strategy info, risk mgmt info, etc.), time the specific block was produced (today, last week, last month, ...) and which agent is responsible for synthesizing that block of info.

      "### Risks Identified:\n",
      "1. **Increased Allocation Drift**: The drift has risen from **2.8%** to **4.1%** over the week, indicating that your portfolio may not be aligned with your target asset allocation. This could expose you to unintended risks or missed opportunities.\n",
      "2. **Volatility Fluctuations**: The risk score showed an uptick to **0.44** on February 13, suggesting increased volatility, although it improved to **0.38** the following day. This fluctuation may indicate market uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actionable Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Given the allocation drift of **4.1%**, it is advisable to rebalance your portfolio to realign with your target asset allocation. This can help mitigate risks associated with overexposure to certain asset classes.\n",
      "2. **Monitor Volatility**: Keep an eye on the risk score and market conditions. If volatility continues to rise, consider adjusting your investment strategy to include more stable assets or hedging options.\n",
      "3. **Review Investment Goals**: Clarify your risk tolerance and investment goals. Are you comfortable with the current level of risk, or do you prefer a more conservative approach? This will guide your rebalancing strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clarifying Questions:\n",
      "- What is your current risk tolerance (low, medium, high)?\n",
      "- What are your specific investment goals (e.g., growth, income, preservation of capital)?\n",
      "- Are there particular sectors or asset classes you are interested in or wish to avoid?\n",

      "============================================================\n",
      "  [Procedural memory updated to v3]\n",
      "Assistant: Thank you for sharing your long-term investment horizon of 20 years. This perspective is crucial for shaping a strategy that aligns with your goals. Here’s a revised summary and recommendations tailored to your long-term investment approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Portfolio Performance Summary (Long-Term Focus):\n",
      "- **February 12, 2026**: Your portfolio was stable with an allocation drift of **2.8%**.\n",
      "- **February 13, 2026**: The portfolio value slightly declined to **$510,800**, with a risk score of **0.44**, indicating increased volatility. The allocation drift increased to **3.5%**, suggesting a rebalance is recommended.\n",
      "- **February 14, 2026**: The portfolio value rose to **$518,000**, reaching a weekly high. The risk score improved to **0.38**, indicating a decrease in risk, but the allocation drift further increased to **4.1%**, which is above the acceptable threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Risks Identified (Long-Term Perspective):\n",
      "1. **Allocation Drift**: The increase in allocation drift from **2.8%** to **4.1%** suggests that your portfolio may be deviating from your long-term target asset allocation. Over time, this can lead to unintended risk exposure or reduced growth potential.\n",
      "2. **Volatility**: The fluctuation in the risk score indicates that while there may be short-term volatility, your long-term investment strategy should focus on resilience and growth. However, it’s essential to monitor these changes to avoid significant downturns.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actionable Recommendations (Long-Term Strategy):\n",
      "1. **Rebalance for Long-Term Alignment**: Given the allocation drift of **4.1%**, consider rebalancing your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your long-term investment strategy. This will help maintain your desired risk-return profile over the next 20 years.\n",
      "2. **Focus on Growth Assets**: Since you have a long investment horizon, consider allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to growth-oriented assets (e.g., equities, real estate) that can benefit from compounding returns over time. However, ensure that you maintain a diversified approach to mitigate risks.\n",
      "3. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Set a schedule to review your portfolio at least annually. This will allow you to adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and your evolving financial goals, ensuring that you remain on track for long-term growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clarifying Questions:\n",
      "- Are there specific sectors or asset classes you are particularly interested in for long-term growth?\n",
      "- How do you feel about incorporating more aggressive growth strategies, given your 20-year horizon?\n",
      "- Would you prefer a more hands-on approach to managing your investments, or would you like to set a more passive strategy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, while focusing on long-term growth, it’s essential to remain adaptable to changing market conditions and personal circumstances. Past performance does not guarantee future results, so continuous evaluation is key to achieving your investment goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Procedural instructions version AFTER feedback: v3\n",
      "\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "TEST 3: Follow-up — does the agent now frame advice around the 20-year horizon?\n",
      "============================================================\n",
      "Assistant: Given the current allocation drift of **4.1%**, which is above the recommended threshold, it would be prudent to consider rebalancing your portfolio now rather than waiting. Here’s why:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reasons to Rebalance Now:\n",
      "1. **Alignment with Long-Term Goals**: Rebalancing helps ensure that your portfolio remains aligned with your long-term investment strategy. A drift beyond the acceptable range can lead to unintended risk exposure, which may not align with your 20-year investment horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mitigating Risk**: The increased allocation drift indicates that certain asset classes may have become overrepresented in your portfolio. By rebalancing, you can reduce the risk associated with overexposure to those assets, especially in a volatile market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Compounding Benefits**: Rebalancing now can help you take advantage of compounding returns over the long term. By maintaining your target asset allocation, you can ensure that your investments are positioned to grow effectively over the next 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Considerations Before Rebalancing:\n",
      "- **Transaction Costs**: Evaluate any potential transaction costs associated with rebalancing. If the costs are significant, you may want to weigh them against the benefits of rebalancing now.\n",
      "- **Market Conditions**: Consider the current market conditions. If you believe that certain assets are undervalued or poised for growth, you might choose to adjust your rebalancing strategy accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "In summary, given the current allocation drift and the importance of maintaining alignment with your long-term investment goals, it is advisable to proceed with rebalancing your portfolio now. This proactive approach can help mitigate risks and position your investments for growth over the next 20 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any specific preferences or concerns regarding the rebalancing process, please let me know!\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice: The response should now emphasize long-term horizon framing from the updated procedural memory.\n"
